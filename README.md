# Fabric Example Mod

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) and [fabric language kotlin wiki page](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-kotlin)
that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## What is the difference from this to the normal fabric template?

This template has several improvements for the modding workflow
compared to the fabric template, but the main one is the fact
that it is already integrated with the Kotlin language. 
Also with ModMenu and ClothConfig already embedded, 
with easy settings to edit at any time without complications.
